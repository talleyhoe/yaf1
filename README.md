# yaf1
Yet another f1 viewer. 

**Goal**
This should allow anyone to scrape all of the f1 streams, and hopefully provide
an interface to launch a player of choice. 

## Todo
- Login pipeline to pull credentials
    - Plain text in config or cmd to run
- List and organize archived races
- Download
    - Setup data directory
    - Allow deletions
- Calendar Integration
    - Scheduling downloads (hooks?)
- Player (not sure about implementation details)
